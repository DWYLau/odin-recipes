Odin Recipe Project HTML

The main aim of this project is to code a simple recipe website.

I will be using knowledge I learned about HTML including links, unordered and ordered lists, images, headers and paragraphs.
I will be writing the boilerplate from memory too - trying to not rely on VCS in-built capabilities.

Finished within 2 hours. Difficulty-wise, it was quite straightforward. I also took the chance to look at other people's work and learnt about the "return to top" function.
In my final updates, I interlinked all my pages together making it easy to return to the home page.

This project also gave me a lot of practice using git and the command line which I was still quite iffy on.
I learned about "git fetch" and "git merge" when I edited my README.md file on GitHub and couldn't commit from my local machine.
